## My work on SICP

`SICP` = **S**tructure and **I**nterpretation of **C**omputer **P**rograms, the legendary text-book as well as course on Programming taught by Profs. Harold Abelson & Gerald Sussman.

This course was traditionally taught using the [Scheme][link_Scheme] language, which is a dialect of [LISP][link_LISP].

This repo contains my programs as I sail through the awesome SICP, 'blue wizard' book, as it is popularly known.

It's a MUST-have book & MUST-watch series of lectures indeed...! :)

Cheers!
