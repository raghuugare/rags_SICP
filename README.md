## My work on SICP

**SICP** = **S**tructure and **I**nterpretation of **C**omputer **P**rograms, the legendary text-book as well as course on Programming taught by Profs. Harold Abelson & Gerald Sussman.

This course was traditionally taught using the [Scheme][link_Scheme] language, which is a dialect of [LISP][link_LISP] as far back as 1980s too!

This repo contains my programs as I sail through the awesome SICP, the 'Wizard book', as it is popularly known.

This is a MUST-have book & the accompanying lectures of 1980's are also Strongly Recommended in deed...! :)

Cheers and Best Wishes!
